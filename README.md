# Insurance Cost Prediction

This project uses the Insurance Cost Prediction dataset from Kaggle to build a model that predicts the cost of insurance for individuals based on various features such as age, sex, BMI, children, smoker status, and region.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about individuals and their insurance costs. The features in the dataset include:

- **age**: Age of the individual
- **sex**: Gender of the individual (male/female)
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index (BMI) of the individual
- **children**: Number of children/dependents covered by the insurance
- **smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker (yes/no)
- **region**: The region in which the individual lives
- **charges**: The insurance charges (target variable)
